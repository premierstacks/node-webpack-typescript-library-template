## üì¶ Preconfigured Features

Here are the key preconfigured features included in this template:

- **Webpack Configuration**

  Utilizes `@premierstacks/webpack-stack` for a finely-tuned Webpack setup, facilitating the management and bundling of assets like HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript, optimized for both development and production environments.

- **TypeScript Support**

  Configured with `@premierstacks/typescript-stack` to leverage TypeScript's powerful features for type safety and developer productivity, aligning with TypeScript best practices.

- **ESLint Integration**

  Integrates `@premierstacks/eslint-stack` to enforce strict linting rules for JavaScript and TypeScript, promoting code quality and consistency throughout the project.

- **Stylelint Configuration**

  Employs `@premierstacks/stylelint-stack` for CSS and SCSS linting, ensuring that styles across the project maintain high quality and consistency.

- **Prettier Formatting**

  Incorporates `@premierstacks/prettier-stack` for unified code formatting, ensuring that all project code adheres to a consistent style for better readability and maintainability.

- **PostCSS Integration**

  Set up with `@premierstacks/postcss-stack` for advanced CSS processing capabilities, including autoprefixing and future CSS features, enhancing the styling workflow.

- **Makefile Goals**

  Features a comprehensive set of predefined Makefile commands to streamline routine development tasks, contributing to an efficient workflow and streamlined CI/CD processes.

## üî• Webpack Configuration Highlights

**Default Entry Points**

The template uses `src/index.ts` as the default entry point, ensuring that your TypeScript library has a clean and structured entry for development.

**TypeScript Transpilation**

TypeScript code is transpiled into JavaScript compatible with Node.js environments, ensuring a modern development experience while targeting the Node.js runtime.

**SCSS to CSS Processing**

SCSS files are compiled into CSS and further processed to apply PostCSS transformations like autoprefixing.

**HTML Management**

HTML files are effectively handled, with automatic injection of scripts and styles into the generated HTML files, streamlining the development process.

**Resource Queries Support**

Supports resource queries in import statements, providing fine-grained control over asset processing:

- **`?asset`**: Automatically decides whether to inline the asset or emit it as a separate file based on its size. This is useful for optimizing load times by inlining small assets and emitting larger ones.
- **`?resource`**: Forces the asset to be emitted as a separate file, regardless of its size. Ideal when you need assets to be cached separately or accessed directly.
- **`?source`**: Imports the asset as a raw source string. Useful for cases where you need the content of the asset directly in your code, such as loading an HTML template or a text file.
- **`?inline`**: Inlines the asset into the bundle regardless of size. Ensures the asset is embedded directly into your code, which can be beneficial for small files or critical assets that must be loaded immediately.

**Asset Management**

Efficient handling of assets like images, fonts, and other files, with customizable output paths and naming conventions, ensures that assets are correctly processed and linked in your application.

**Code Splitting and Optimization**

Employs optimized code splitting strategies to improve load times, with chunks configured for better caching and performance.

**Build Optimizations**

Integrates various plugins to minimize and optimize CSS, HTML, JSON, and image assets for production builds, enhancing performance without the need for detailed configuration.

**Environment-Specific Configurations**

Adjusts settings based on the environment (development or production) to ensure optimal performance and features appropriate for each stage.

**Extensibility and Customization**

The Webpack configuration is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing you to modify and extend it according to your project's specific requirements.
